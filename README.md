# FCFS-scheduling
First come first serve Scheduling algorithm is a scheduling process where the process gets executed on their arrival.

Completion time :- | p1  |  p2  | p3  |
                   0  -  10  -  15  -  23
Note:-We ignore the priority in this algorithm, first to come will get the job done first.                  
Turn around time=completion time-arrival time
Waiting time=turn around time - burst time
